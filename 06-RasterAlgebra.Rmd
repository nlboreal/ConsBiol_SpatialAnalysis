#RASTER ALGEBRA {#rasterAlgebra}

It is possible to analyse and combien two different rasters. The second raster layer in the SJER foler is a digital surface model (dsm) which is a data set taken using Lidar data that measures the height of the objects (above sea level) of objects on the earth. Let's load that layer.

```{r}
SJER_dsm <- read_stars("SJER_dsmFull.tif")
```

By subtracting the dtm (elevation of the ground above sea level) from the dsm (elevation of the objects on the ground above sea level) we can create a new raster that represents the height of those objects above the ground. Since this layer is in a forest, we can infer that this new layer is the canopy height. 

```{r}
SJER_canopy = SJER_dsm - SJER_dtm
```

Raster algebra can use any algebraic functions - for example if we wanted to convert the units of the canopy layer from metres to centimetres, we could simply multiply the SJER_canopy layer by 10.
